    "In this notebook, we will be using the Scikit-Learn library to build a machine learning model to predict whether an employee will leave the company or not. We will be using the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset. We processed the original dataset using our ETL script and saved the processed dataset as a CSV file. We will be using this processed dataset for our machine learning model.\n",

    "Several machine learning models will be trained and evaluated to determine the best model for this classification task. Finally, the most effective model will be used to make predictions on the test data. Overall, we will be following the following steps:\n",
    "- **Data Preparation**: This involves loading the data. We don't need to preprocess or clean the data since we already did that in the ETL script.\n",
    "- **Model Selection**: We will be choosing a suitable learning algorithm for the classification task. This can be done by considering the nature of the problem and the type of data, as well as experimenting with different algorithms to find the best fit. We have chosen the following algorithms:\n",
    "    - Logistic Regression\n",
    "    - Decision Tree\n",
    "    - Support Vector Machine\n",
    "    - K-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "- **Model Training**: In this part, we will be feeding the training data into each algorithm to train the model.\n",
    "- **Model Evaluation**: We will be testing the model on the test data to evaluate its performance, and will be using the following metrics to measure the performance of the model:\n",
    "    - Accuracy\n",
    "    - Precision\n",
    "    - Recall\n",
    "    - F1 Score\n",
    "    - ROC AUC Score\n",
    "- **Model Fine-Tuning**: This involves adjusting the hyperparameters of the model to improve its performance. We will do this by using the technique known as grid search. This technique will allow us to find the best combination of hyperparameters for each model.\n",
    "- **Model Deployment**: We will be using the trained model to make predictions on new data. The model can be deployed in a variety of ways, including as a standalone application, as a web service, or as a component of a larger system. In this notebook though, we will be deploying it as a simple Python script.\n",

    "Throughout the notebook, the results of each step will be visually represented and analyzed to gain insights and inform the decision-making process."

    "Now, we will be testing the DecisionTreeClassifier model. This model can be used for both classification and regression tasks, but this specifict version is used only for classification. It works by recursively splitting the data into smaller groups based on the values of the input features, and making a prediction based on the group the data point belongs to. They are very powerful and flexible, but they can also be prone to overfitting.\n",

    "- **Max Depth**: Specifies the maximum depth of the tree. Deeper trees may result in overfitting, so it is important to set a maximum depth.\n",
